State Machine Notes.
----------------------


In the blockchain, 

- the state machine will be represented by a UTxO sitting at the state machine address. 
- The state of the machine will be the datum of that UTxO. 
- A transition will be a transaction that consumes the current state, using a redeemer that characterizes the transition, and then produces a new UTxO at the same address, where the datum now reflects the new state.
